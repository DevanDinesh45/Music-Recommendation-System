# Music-Recommendation-System
I uploaded the dataset to a Google Colab after downloading it from Kaggle. After that, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis. Created a pipeline and fit it in one go and also created another pipeline and applied t-SNE transformation and visualized it. Taken the spotipy library to download the songs from spotify and recommended the songs.
